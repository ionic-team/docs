# `@ionic-docs/preset-classic`

Ionic flavored [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) preset

This preset extends the `@docusaurus/preset-classic` package. It offers a few more npm packages bundled with it than the original and extends some docusaurus config types.

The `@docusaurus/theme-classic` and `@ionic-docs/theme-classic` packages are both used as a base. A scoped css cascade layers polyfill is also included.
